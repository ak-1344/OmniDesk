We are going to work on a Personalised Desk making website project. These are the details of the project:Project idea:OmniDesk — A Personal Thinking & Execution Environment1. What OmniDesk Feels Like (User Perspective)OmniDesk is not a productivity app that forces behavior.It is a personal operating environment where thoughts, plans, and commitments live in their natural forms.As a user, OmniDesk does not ask me to be “organized” first.It allows me to:think freely,commit intentionally,execute step by step,and review without guilt.Everything exists in one place, but nothing is mixed incorrectly.2. Global Layout & ExperienceOverall UI FeelCalm, focused, minimalDark-mode friendly by defaultGrid-based layouts for spatial awarenessClear separation between overview and deep workSidebar always present, like a system dockNavigation PhilosophyNo page feels overloadedEach page answers one mental questionSwitching pages feels like switching mental modes3. Sidebar (System Dock)The sidebar acts like a personal command dock, similar to an OS launcher.It contains:DashboardTasksIdeasAll Tasks (List View)CalendarTerminalTrashSettingsPortfolio (already implemented)Icons are primary, labels are secondary.The dock stays consistent across the entire system, reinforcing orientation.4. Dashboard — “What’s Going On in My Life Right Now?”PurposeThe Dashboard is the entry point and reality check.It answers:“What am I currently dealing with?”Visual StructureA grid-based layoutMultiple sections representing task statesEach section is visually distinct but part of one unified viewWhat the User SeesActive tasks grouped by current statusClear separation between:Early-stage thoughts that became tasksOngoing workNearly completed workTemporarily paused workEach task appears as a compact card showing:Task nameDomain (College, Startup, Club, Personal, etc.)Progress indicatorDeadline (if any)Interaction ExperienceTasks are not edited deeply hereThe Dashboard is about awareness, not micromanagementClicking a task takes the user deeper into executionFilters at the top allow:Domain-based focusDeadline-based focusTemporary “zoomed-in” dashboardsThe Dashboard always feels high-level, calm, and informative.5. Ideas — Brain Vomit SpacePurposeThis is the most private, judgment-free area of OmniDesk.It answers:“What’s going on in my head?”ExperienceFeels like a personal journalNo structure is enforcedWriting feels similar to drafting an email or a diary entryWhat an Idea IsAn idea is:A thoughtA planA rantA realizationA questionA half-formed ambitionIdeas:Do NOT have deadlinesDo NOT appear in the DashboardDo NOT have subtasksThey exist purely for thinking and expression.Key Feature: Convert to TaskEach idea has a clear option:“Turn this into a task”When used:The idea remains intactA new task is created using the idea’s contentThe user intentionally decides:DomainPriorityInitial task stateThis preserves the boundary between thinking and doing.6. Tasks — Execution OverviewPurposeThe Tasks page is where commitments live.It answers:“What have I committed to doing?”Visual LayoutCard-based grid layoutEach card represents one taskCards are visually richer than Dashboard cardsEach task card shows:Task nameShort descriptionDomainCompletion progressDeadlineSubtask countInteraction ModelThis page is more interactive than DashboardClicking a card opens the task execution spaceTasks are not cluttered with subtasks hereIt’s a bridge between overview and deep execution7. Task Execution Space — Where Real Work HappensThis is the heart of OmniDesk.PurposeIt answers:“How do I actually complete this?”LayoutWhen a task is opened:The screen shifts into a focused execution environmentThe task’s details are always visibleSubtasks are the primary focusSubtask Kanban (Task-Specific)Each task has its own internal workflow board:Subtasks are organized by statesStates reflect progress, not pressureDrag-and-drop is available hereThis is the only place Kanban exists, and it feels natural here.Subtask FeaturesEach subtask can have:Its own descriptionDeadlineScheduled time blockProof or attachment upon completionSubtasks feel lightweight and actionable.Completion ExperienceCompleting subtasks visibly progresses the taskA task never feels “done abruptly”Reflection notes and proof can be added8. All Tasks — List View (Clarity Mode)PurposeThis page exists for mental clarity and auditing.It answers:“Show me everything, cleanly.”LayoutTable-based viewOne row per taskColumns include:Task nameShort descriptionDomainCurrent statusDeadlineSubtasksDisplayed in a collapsible tree under each taskIndented and visually subordinateEasy to scan without opening tasksThis view is ideal when:Reviewing workloadFeeling overwhelmedPlanning adjustments9. Calendar — Time DimensionPurposeThe Calendar shows when things happen, not what they are.It answers:“What am I doing and when?”What Appears HereTask deadlinesScheduled subtasksPersonal eventsPlans that are not tasksInteraction ExperienceTasks or subtasks can be scheduled directly from hereEvents can exist without being tasksThe calendar respects flexibility, not rigidityThe Calendar complements the Dashboard:Dashboard = stateCalendar = time10. Terminal — Power Input ModePurposeThis is a fast, expressive control interface.It answers:“Let me just dump or script this.”ExperienceTerminal-like inputAccepts structured input formatsAllows bulk creation of:TasksSubtasksEventsThis is especially useful when:Planning large initiativesMigrating ideasThinking in structured blocksIt feels optional, not forced.11. Trash — Safety & ConfidencePurposeThe Trash gives the user freedom to delete without fear.ExperienceAnything deleted goes hereItems remain for a defined periodRestore is easy and visibleThis encourages:CleanlinessExperimentationReduced anxiety12. Settings — Personal System ControlPurposeSettings allow OmniDesk to adapt to the user, not the opposite.What Can Be ManagedDomainsTask statesVisual preferencesDefault behaviorsRetention rulesThis ensures OmniDesk remains personal, even as it grows.13. Portfolio Integration (Already Done)From the user’s perspective:Portfolio is an output layerTasks can be promoted to public artifactsVisibility is intentional and controlledThe portfolio never interferes with thinking or execution.14. What OmniDesk Ultimately BecomesTo the user, OmniDesk becomes:A second brainA thinking spaceAn execution engineA reflection systemA personal archiveIt does not compete with productivity tools.It replaces fragmentation.Final Note (Important)OmniDesk does not demand discipline.It reveals reality, and lets the user respond to it.That is why it will actually be used."Great, now this is how the webpage is gonna look like:OmniDesk – UI & Page-Level Specification🌐 GLOBAL UI SYSTEM (Applies to All Pages)Overall Look & FeelDark-first interface with soft contrastSubtle shadows, rounded containersGrid-aligned layoutsNo harsh borders; separation via spacing and toneMinimal animations (fade, slide, expand)Persistent ElementsLeft Sidebar (Dock-style) – visible on all pagesTop Context Bar – page title + page-specific actionsMain Content Area – changes per page📌 SIDEBAR (SYSTEM DOCK)PositionLeft side, fixedNarrow by default, expandable on hoverContents (Top to Bottom)DashboardTasksIdeasAll TasksCalendarTerminalTrashSettingsPortfolioBehaviorIcon-first, label on hoverActive page highlightedSidebar never scrolls with contentRequirementMust allow instant page switchingMust never feel clutteredMust visually feel like an OS dock🏠 1.

PORTFOLIO PAGEPurposePublic-facing output control.LayoutToggle visibility of projectsManage published contentRequirementsMust not interfere with workflowMust clearly separate public vs private🧠 Final UX PrincipleEvery page in OmniDesk answers one mental question.No page tries to do more.That’s why OmniDesk works.This is how a User must be able to use the website:A User’s Life Inside OmniDesk“I don’t use OmniDesk to manage tasks.I use it to manage my mind.”1. First-Time Setup — Making OmniDesk MineSetting Up DomainsOn first use, I open Settings → Domains.I create domains that actually reflect my life:CollegeClubStartupPersonalHealthPlacementEach domain gets:A nameA colorAn optional descriptionNow, every future task or idea will feel anchored to a life area.👉 This immediately reduces mental chaos.2. Brain Dump — Creating an Idea (No Pressure)I’m walking back from college.A random thought hits me.Instead of opening Notes or WhatsApp, I open Ideas.WorkflowClick + New IdeaA blank, calm writing space opensI write freely:No titleNo deadlineNo structureI save and close.Nothing asks me what I’ll do with it.👉 OmniDesk respects thinking before action.3. Turning an Idea into a Task (Intentional Commitment)Two days later, I revisit that idea.I realize:“This actually needs to be done.”WorkflowOpen the ideaClick Convert to TaskA task creation panel opens with idea text pre-filledI now choose:Task nameDomain: StartupInitial status: Gotta StartThe idea remains as it was.A new commitment is born.👉 No accidental commitments. Everything is intentional.4. Creating a Task Directly (Execution Mode)Sometimes I don’t want to think — I just need to act.WorkflowGo to DashboardClick + New TaskA mail-like compose window opens:Subject → Task nameBody → DescriptionI add:DomainDeadline (optional)Status (defaulted)The task appears instantly in the Dashboard.👉 Fast capture without breaking flow.5. Viewing Life at a Glance — Dashboard UsageAt night, I open Dashboard.I see:What I’ve startedWhat’s ongoingWhat’s nearly doneWhat’s pausedI don’t see:Old ideasCompleted noiseOverwhelming listsThe Dashboard answers:“What is demanding my attention right now?”👉 Less anxiety, more awareness.6. Deep Work — Creating Subtasks Inside a TaskI open a task that feels big.Inside the Task Execution Space:I add subtasksEach subtask is small and clearI don’t overthink the orderSubtasks appear as cards in the task’s internal Kanban.I drag them as I work.👉 Progress feels visible and real.7. Editing Kanban States (Global & Task-Level)Global AdjustmentOver time, I realize my workflow has changed.I open Settings → Task States.I:Rename a stateReorder statesAdd a new oneNow every task adapts.Task-Level AdjustmentOne task needs a custom flow.Inside the task:I tweak subtask states just for this taskIt doesn’t affect anything else👉 The system adapts to me, not the opposite.8. Planning Time — Using the CalendarI open Calendar.I see:DeadlinesScheduled subtasksPersonal eventsScheduling WorkI drag a subtask into a time slot:“30 minutes, 6–6:30 PM”Now:It appears in the calendarIt remains part of the taskI know exactly when I’ll work on itCreating EventsI add:A meetingA reminderA personal planNot everything needs to be a task.👉 Time becomes visible, not stressful.9. Setting Reminders (Without Extra Effort)Because tasks and subtasks are scheduled:OmniDesk already knows when to remind meI don’t set reminders manuallyWhen the time comes:I get a gentle nudgeNot an aggressive alert👉 Reminders feel helpful, not annoying.10. Cleaning Up — Using Trash ConfidentlyI abandon a task.Instead of hesitating:I delete itIt goes to Trash.I know:I can restore itIt won’t haunt me foreverLater, I permanently delete it.👉 Mental clutter reduces because deletion is safe.11. Using the Terminal — Planning a Whole Project at OnceI want to plan a personal project.Instead of clicking endlessly:I open TerminalI paste a structured plan:Main taskSubtasksDeadlinesDomainI preview.I confirm.The entire project appears instantly.👉 Planning feels powerful, not tedious.12. Switching Perspectives — List ViewOne day I feel overwhelmed.I open All Tasks.I see:Everything in rowsDomains clearly separatedDeadlines clearly visibleI collapse subtasks.I sort by domain.Suddenly:“Oh. This is manageable.”👉 Perspective restores control.13. Managing Multiple Life DomainsBecause every task has a domain:I can filter my entire systemView only:CollegeStartupPersonal lifeI realize:Where I’m overworkingWhere I’m neglecting👉 Life balance becomes visible.14. Reflection & ProofWhen a task finishes:I add screenshotsI add notesI record what I learnedLater:This becomes portfolio materialOr personal growth evidence👉 Work doesn’t disappear after completion.15. Portfolio Extraction (Quietly)I open Portfolio Settings.I choose:Which completed tasks to publishWhat to hideWhat to polishMy public identity is now:CuratedHonestEffortless👉 Portfolio is a byproduct, not extra work.16. Long-Term Impact on LifeOver weeks and months:Ideas stop getting lostTasks stop feeling heavyProgress becomes visibleStress reducesI no longer ask:“What should I do?”I simply look.Final TruthOmniDesk doesn’t make me productive.It makes me clear.And clarity changes everything.
