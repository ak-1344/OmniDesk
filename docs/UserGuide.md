## Getting Started
OmniDesk is designed to prioritize your thoughts before they become rigid tasks. Everything is reversible, and structure adapts to you.

To begin, simply navigate to the [Dashboard](/dashboard) to get a high-level view of your workspace.

## Dashboard Overview
The Dashboard is your command center. It provides:
- **Greeting**: A personalized welcome.
- **Quick Stats**: Overview of pending tasks, active ideas, and upcoming events.
- **Recent Activity**: A snapshot of what you've been working on.

## Ideas First
Not every thought needs to be a task immediately. Use the **Ideas** section to capture thoughts freely.
- **Create an Idea**: Click the "New Idea" button.
- **Canvas View**: Each idea has a spatial canvas. You can move items around, zoom in/out, and organize thoughts visually.
- **Convert to Task**: When an idea is ready for action, you can easily convert it into a tracking task.

## Task Management
Manage your execution in the **Tasks** section.
- **Kanban Board**: Visualize your workflow with drag-and-drop columns (e.g., Todo, In Progress, Done).
- **Subtasks**: Break down complex tasks into manageable steps.
- **Priorities**: Assign priorities (Low, Medium, High) to stay focused.

## Calendar & Events
The **Calendar** helps you maintain awareness of time without the pressure.
- **Weekly View**: See your week at a glance.
- **Events**: Add events to keep track of deadlines or meetings.
- **Integration**: Tasks with due dates appear automatically.

## Settings
Customize your OmniDesk experience in **Settings**.
- **Profile**: Update your name and email.
- **Domains**: Manage the different areas of your life (e.g., Work, Personal) with custom colors.
- **Kanban States**: Customize the columns on your task board to match your workflow.
