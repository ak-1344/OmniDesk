# OmniDesk — Your Personal Thinking & Execution Environment

> *"I don't use OmniDesk to manage tasks. I use it to manage my mind."*

---

## What is OmniDesk?

**OmniDesk is not another productivity app.**

It's a personal operating environment where your thoughts, plans, and commitments exist in their natural forms — without forcing you into rigid structures or demanding discipline you don't have.

Think of it as **your second brain**: a space that lets you think freely, commit intentionally, execute step-by-step, and review without guilt.

Most productivity tools ask you to be organized first. OmniDesk starts where you are — chaotic, scattered, overwhelmed — and helps you see reality clearly so you can respond to it naturally.

## The Core Philosophy

OmniDesk respects three fundamental truths about how humans actually work:

### 1. **Thinking ≠ Doing**
Not every thought needs to become a task. OmniDesk gives you space to think, rant, dream, and explore — without pressure to act on everything.

### 2. **Awareness > Urgency**
Instead of screaming notifications and red badges, OmniDesk shows you what's happening in your life right now. Calmly. Clearly.

### 3. **Personal Systems Are Unique**
Your life domains (College, Startup, Health, Personal) are not the same as anyone else's. OmniDesk adapts to your reality, not someone else's template.

## How OmniDesk Works

### The Mental Model

Imagine OmniDesk as **your personal operating system** — like macOS or Windows, but for your thoughts and commitments.

On the left, you have a **dock** (sidebar) with different "applications" (pages), each serving one specific mental purpose:

- **Dashboard** — "What's happening in my life right now?"
- **Ideas** — "What's going on in my head?"
- **Kanban** — "What should move forward?"
- **Tasks** — "What have I committed to doing?"
- **Calendar** — "When does this happen?"
- **Terminal** — "Let me dump everything at once."
- **Trash** — "Delete safely, restore easily."
- **Settings** — "Make this system mine."

Each page answers exactly one question. Nothing more. Nothing less.

## The Journey Through OmniDesk

### 🧠 Starting Point: Brain Dump (Ideas)

You're walking back from class. A random thought hits you.

Instead of losing it in a crowded Notes app or forgetting it entirely, you open **Ideas** in OmniDesk.

**What you see:**
- A calm, judgment-free space
- No templates
- No required fields
- No deadlines staring at you

**What you do:**
- Just write
- No title needed
- No structure required
- Save and close

---

### 🧩 The Infinite Canvas (Ideas Only)

Each **Idea is its own world**.

When you open an idea, you enter an **infinite canvas** — a visual thinking space designed purely for exploration.

On this canvas, you can:
- Create multiple **note cards** (draggable, resizable, free-positioned)
- Write fragmented or structured thoughts inside cards
- Add diagrams, charts, sketches, or images
- Arrange ideas spatially instead of linearly
- Explore without worrying about order, flow, or completion

Connections between cards are **optional**, not mandatory — similar to an n8n-style canvas, but without execution pressure. Nodes are **thoughts**, not actions.

The canvas can be:
- Infinite (default)
- Bounded (fixed workspace)
- Turned off entirely (simple text view)

**Important boundary:**
- Infinite canvas exists **only for Ideas**
- Tasks and subtasks never use the canvas

**The experience:** It feels like thinking on a whiteboard, not filling out a form.

---

### ✨ Intentional Commitment (Convert Idea to Task)

Two days later, you revisit an idea.

You realize: *"This actually needs to happen."*

**What you do:**
- Click **"Convert to Task"**
- The idea’s content appears in a task creation window
- You intentionally choose:
  - Domain (College, Startup, Personal, etc.)
  - Initial Kanban state
  - Optional deadline

**What happens:**
- The idea remains untouched
- A new task is created
- A sidebar shows all tasks derived from this idea
- You can always trace execution back to original thinking

**The experience:** Nothing becomes a task by accident.

---

### 📍 Reality Check (Dashboard)

At the end of the day, you open your **Dashboard**.

**What you see:**
- A clean, grid-based overview of current work
- Tasks grouped by their present state
- Only active and relevant items

Each task card shows:
- Name
- Domain badge
- Progress indicator
- Deadline (if any)

**What you don’t see:**
- Completed noise
- Old ideas
- Unnecessary detail

**The experience:** You see reality without judgment.

---

### 🔄 Global Flow Control (Kanban)

You open **Kanban**.

This is where **tasks move**.

**What you see:**
- A global Kanban board
- Columns representing your custom workflow states
- Tasks as movable cards

**What you do:**
- Drag tasks across states as work progresses
- Visually manage execution flow
- Reprioritize intuitively

Kanban here is about **shuffling tasks forward**, not micromanaging subtasks.

---

### 🎯 Deep Work (Task Execution)

You open a task.

You enter **Task Execution Mode**.

**What you see:**
- Task title and description
- Domain and deadline visible but quiet
- A **task-specific Kanban board for subtasks**

**What you do:**
- Break work into subtasks
- Move subtasks across states
- Add deadlines or time blocks
- Attach proof or reflections when done

**The experience:** Progress becomes visible and motivating.

---

### 🗂️ Clarity Mode (All Tasks List View)

When overwhelmed, you open **All Tasks**.

**What you see:**
- Every task in a structured table
- Columns for domain, state, deadline
- Subtasks shown as collapsible trees

**The experience:** Perspective returns. Control is restored.

---

### 📅 Time Dimension (Calendar)

You open **Calendar**.

This is the **time surface** of OmniDesk.

**What appears here:**
- Task deadlines
- Scheduled subtasks
- Personal events (not everything is a task)

**What you do:**
- Drag tasks or subtasks into time slots
- Create standalone events
- Plan days or weeks visually

Notifications are **derived from the calendar** and will be added later — gently, not urgently.

---

### ⚡ Power Mode (Terminal)

You want to plan an entire project at once.

You open **Terminal**.

**What you do:**
- Paste structured text
- Preview tasks, subtasks, domains, deadlines
- Confirm

**What happens:**
- Everything appears instantly, correctly structured

---

### 🎨 Personalization (Settings)

In **Settings**, you define your system:

- **Domains** — life areas that matter to you
- **Kanban states** — globally and per task
- **Defaults** — creation behavior, retention rules

OmniDesk adapts to you.

---

### 🗑️ Safe Deletion (Trash)

You delete a task or idea.

It goes to **Trash**.

You can:
- Restore anytime
- Let it auto-expire

Deletion is safe. Cleanup is easy.

---

### 🌐 Public Output (Portfolio)

Completed tasks can be selectively published.

Your portfolio becomes:
- Curated
- Honest
- Effortless

A byproduct of real work.
